# Raspberry Pi Buildroot fwup example

All of this is very much based on [Frank Hunleth's work](https://github.com/fhunleth/bbb-buildroot-fwup) and [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org).

Raspberry 3 wifi firmware is taken from [firmware-nonfree](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree).

Firmware for bluetooth module is taken from
[OpenELEC](https://github.com/OpenELEC/misc-firmware/blob/master/firmware/brcm/BCM43430A1.hcd)
